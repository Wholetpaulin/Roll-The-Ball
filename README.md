# Roll-The-Ball
This is a simple test to see if I can host Unity games via github pages. I made this game using the tutorial found at https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials


### Instructions

1. Click on the designated link:     https://wholetpaulin.github.io/Roll-The-Ball/

2. Wait ~10 seconds on the gray loading screen until you see the Unity symbol.

3. Use the wasd or arrow keys to roll the ball around to pick up the game pieces.

4. Collect all the yellow pieces to win!
